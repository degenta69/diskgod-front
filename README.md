# React 😎 + Tailwind 💨 Project Starter Template 
Use until create-react-app doesn't support PostCSS 8.

## How to use?
1. Do `git clone https://github.com/tanmayhinge/react-tailwind-template.git` or easily [ Generate template](https://github.com/tanmayhinge/react-tailwind-template/generate)
2. In the command line, do `npm install` to install all the dependencies. 
3. `npm start` ⚙️

## Why did I make this?
I was using Tailwind with react a lot and felt the whole process of setting up tailwind every time quite the fuss.  

#### Why the fuss?
Create React App doesn't support PostCSS 8 yet so you need to install the Tailwind CSS v2.0 PostCSS 7. Also since Create React App doesn't let you override the PostCSS configuration natively, CRACO is used.
